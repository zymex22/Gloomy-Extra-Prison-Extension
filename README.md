![alt text](http://www.foxbyrd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/file-4.jpg "Work in progress")  
(anything in this mod can be changed at anytime before full release)  
  
Idea behind this mod is to make one complete Prison item/stuff mod.

### Mod will add:
- Decor items
- Structures
- Items
- Patches/compabilitiy for other mods

### Mod will not include:
- slave/prison mod

All items will be focsued around prison stuff.

Inspiration is from mods like: Expanded doors, prison expansion(b18), 
Texture Theme is in style with GloomyLynx, Gloomy furniture mod.
And will be made in a filthy medieval/industrial age style.

## Goal
Goal is this mod will be a All-in-One prison item mod instead have to  use 3-8 mods for that.  
  
Please feel free to contribute to this mod with ideas, work, textures, or other.  
you can open an issue and we will look at it.
